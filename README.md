  This repo is an attempt to read in corn leaf images dataset that is made available in Kaggle.com.  
  There are totally 4225 images belonging to two classes - 'Healthy corn' and 'Infected'.  
  The task is to  build a model that can accurately identify whether the leaves are healthy or infected.  
  There is an attempt to build a Neural Net with Convolution and Max Pooling.   
  Also , pre trained model such as MobileNet is also tested for the purpose.  
  Self created Test Data set is uploaded which contains 34 images of corn leaves.  
    
  Conclusion: Test set accuracy is not consistent across models and not obtained beyond 53% . This is a rough attempt and need to work on  the quality of input training dataset.
